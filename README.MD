# WIP: I Bricked My Device
## This is messy informations. 

- I did not notice that it had updated after a wipe.
- Flashed the bootloader; now it is bricked.
- Device initially was bootlooping. I tried holding the button to see if that would allow me to recover or do anything.
- Now it boots to the 'onn' boot screen logo and is not detected by the computer via USB.

## Rooting/Unlocking Information
- **Rooting**:
  - Use a mcrousb cable from the Onn Android box to the computer.
  - Enable Developer Options and Debugging (may need to restart to work).
  - .... root and things I didn't write this out yet. 
  
- **Input Issues**: You might encounter random issues with inputs, such as buttons not clicking or selections not visible. For troubleshooting, consider using a reliable OTG cable or ADBAppControl ([link](https://adbappcontrol.com/en/)).

- **Script Status**: The scripts provided are incomplete. However, you might find some useful elements in them.

- **OEM Unlock**:
  - If the OEM unlock option is greyed out, try the following steps:
    - Reboot into fastboot mode: `adb reboot fastboot`
    - Execute the OEM flashing unlock command (if I recall correctly).

- **Magisk Issues**:
  - Magisk v27 had compatibility issues. If you encounter problems, reverting to Magisk v26.1, as suggested by many write-ups, might resolve them. As of July 2024, Magisk v27 is known to have issues. Avoid using it or upgrading from v26.1 to v27.

- **Debloat Caution**:
  - Be cautious when debloating. Testing scripts might inadvertently cause system issues. If this happens, a reset and fresh start might be necessary.

- **USB Debugging**:
  - Enabling USB debugging might require a specific sequence to function properly. If it doesnâ€™t work initially, try restarting the device.

- **ADB over Wi-Fi**:
  - ADB can operate over Wi-Fi. Use the command: `adb connect <ip>:5555`.

- **Firmware**:
  - I have downloaded various firmwares, including an unofficial Lineage 21 version and an OTA.zip of a different version. No additional modifications have been made.
