# WIP: I Bricked My Device
## Overview

**Device Status**:
- After a wipe, the device updated.
- Flashing the bootloader resulted in bricking.
- Initially in a bootloop; now it boots to the 'onn' boot screen logo but isn't detected by the computer via USB.

## Rooting and Unlocking Information

### Rooting
- **Cable**: Use a micro-USB cable from the Onn Android box to the computer.
- **Developer Options and Debugging**:
  - Enable Developer Options.
  - Enable USB Debugging (may need a restart to take effect).
  - Detailed rooting steps to be added.

### Input Issues
- You might encounter random issues with inputs, such as buttons not clicking or selections not visible. For troubleshooting, consider using a reliable OTG cable or ADBAppControl ([link](https://adbappcontrol.com/en/)).

### Script Status
- The scripts provided are incomplete. However, you might find some useful elements in them.

### OEM Unlock
- If the OEM unlock option is greyed out, try the following steps:
  - Reboot into fastboot mode: `adb reboot fastboot`
  - Execute the OEM flashing unlock command.

### Magisk Issues
- Magisk v27 had compatibility issues. If you encounter problems, reverting to Magisk v26.1, as suggested by many write-ups, might resolve them. As of July 2024, Magisk v27 is known to have issues. Avoid using it or upgrading from v26.1 to v27.

### Debloat Caution
- Be cautious when debloating. Testing scripts might inadvertently cause system issues. If this happens, a reset and fresh start might be necessary.

### USB Debugging
- Enabling USB debugging might require a specific sequence to function properly. If it doesnâ€™t work initially, try restarting the device.

### ADB over Wi-Fi
- ADB can operate over Wi-Fi. Use the command: `adb connect <ip>:5555`.

### Firmware
- I have downloaded various firmwares, including an unofficial Lineage 21 version and an OTA.zip of a different version. No additional modifications have been made.

## FW Version & Issues

- As of now (July 2024) only the older FW revisions can be unlocked and rooted. Once upgraded, you cannot downgrade.
- Unlockable and rootable versions can be identified by the number on the bottom of the box under the serial number.
  - Versions 23xx can be unlocked & rooted; versions 24xx are updated and cannot.
- The Amlogic chip does not work with previous tools such as USB burn. Instead, they are based on ADNL, which has little documentation and only a small number of people working on it.
- Shorting a test point to the shield during boot will get the device into the bootloader, but a password is required to do anything, which is currently a dead end.
